<h2>Customer Churn Analysis</h2>

<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>
  The aim of this analysis is to shed light on customer behavior, demographic trends, and patterns of churn.
  Modern enterprises face the challenge of customer migration, and understanding the underlying reasons and contributing factors is crucial for developing effective retention strategies.
</p>

<h3>Data / Tools Used</h3>
<p>Power BI, Excel</p>

<h3>Analysis / Approach</h3>
<p>
  The dataset was obtained in CSV format and pre-processed to ensure accuracy and consistency. 
  To guide the analysis, a series of key questions were formulated aimed at understanding why customers churn, identifying demographic trends, and uncovering patterns in customer behavior.
  For each question, observations were made, and hypotheses were developed and tested to validate insights. The analysis was organized in a booklet-style format, making it easy to follow for stakeholders.
  Using Excel and Power BI, interactive dashboards and visualizations were created to highlight high-risk customer segments, trends across demographics, and engagement patterns. 
  The goal was to provide a clear and actionable view of churn, helping businesses make data-driven retention decisions.

<h3>Impact / Learning</h3>
<p>
  The analysis provided a clear understanding of which customer segments were most likely to churn, helping stakeholders prioritize retention efforts. Insights 
  from the dashboard and visualizations enabled data-driven strategies to improve customer engagement and loyalty, ultimately supporting better decision-making 
  in marketing and customer relationship management.
  This project strengthened my skills in Excel and Power BI, particularly in data cleaning, visualization, and dashboard design. I also learned how to structure analysis 
  around key business questions, formulate hypotheses, and present insights in a clear, actionable format for stakeholders. 
  Additionally, I gained experience in interpreting customer behavior patterns and translating them into strategic recommendations.
