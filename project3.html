<h3>PROBLEM</h3>
<p>The goal of this project was to identify the key factors contributing to diabetes risk among patients and provide actionable insights for early awareness and preventive measures. 
  By analyzing patient health indicators, the objective was to uncover patterns and relationships that could help predict the likelihood of developing diabetes, enabling stakeholders 
  to make informed health interventions and raise awareness about potential risk factors.

<h3>ANALYSIS / APPROACH</h3>
<p>The dataset was obtained from Kaggle and pre-processed to ensure accuracy and consistency. A set of key questions was formulated to identify factors contributing to diabetes risk among patients. 
   Using SQL, the data was queried to answer these questions, uncover patterns, and rank contributing risk parameters.
   The processed results were then imported into Power BI, where interactive visualizations were created to clearly communicate findings. 
  The dashboard highlighted which health indicators were most strongly associated with diabetes risk and provided stakeholders with a structured, data-driven view of patient risk profiles.

<h3>IMPACT / LEARNING</h3>
<p>
The analysis highlighted the key health indicators that contribute most to diabetes risk, providing stakeholders with actionable insights for early intervention and awareness programs. 
By identifying high-risk patients and patterns in the data, the project enables informed health strategies and preventive measures, supporting better patient outcomes.
Learning
This project strengthened my skills in SQL for data querying, Power BI for interactive visualization, and data-driven decision-making. 
I also learned how to formulate meaningful questions from a dataset, translate analytical results into actionable insights, and present complex health data in a clear, stakeholder-friendly format.
