<h2>Sales Superstore Dashboard</h2>

<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>The goal of this project was to analyze sales data from a retail superstore to understand overall business performance, identify trends in revenue and profit, and evaluate product and regional performance. 
  The objective was to create an interactive dashboard that enables stakeholders to quickly explore sales patterns, detect high- and low-performing products, and make informed business decisions.</p>

<h3>Data / Tools Used</h3>
<p>SQL, Power BI</p>

<h3>Analysis / Approach</h3>
<p>The dataset was obtained in CSV format, cleaned in Excel to handle missing values and formatting issues, and then imported into Power BI for analysis. The dashboard was structured into four sections:
Summary – Provided a high-level overview of total sales, profit, and key metrics.
Sales Analysis – Detailed insights into sales by category, subcategory, region, and year. Used bar charts, column charts, and tables to highlight trends and comparisons.
Forecasting – Predicted future sales trends using line charts to help stakeholders plan ahead.
Actionables – Suggested recommendations and next steps based on insights from the analysis.</p>
