<h2> IRIS SPECIES CLASSIFICATION </h2>
</div>

<div class="box">
<h3>PROBLEM</h3>
<p>
  The goal of this project was to classify iris flowers into their respective species based on measurable features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. 
  By analyzing these features, the objective was to build a predictive model capable of accurately identifying the species of an iris flower, while demonstrating skills in 
  data preprocessing, feature analysis, and supervised machine learning using Python.

<h3>ANALYSIS / APPROACH</h3>
<p>
  The dataset was obtained from Kaggle and pre-processed to ensure consistency and accuracy. 
  The main objective was to separate and classify the iris species based on measurable features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. 
  Initially, linear regression was attempted to differentiate the species, but it did not yield meaningful separation. The analysis then moved to K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification, 
  testing various feature combinations and pairs to determine which features best separated the species.
  Scatter plots were created for each feature pair to visually inspect separability. Finally, all species comparisons were plotted on a single comprehensive plot,
  and the classification results were analyzed to evaluate accuracy and interpret patterns in the data.

<h3>IMPACT / LEARNING</h3>
<p>Impact: 
The analysis demonstrated how different iris species could be distinguished based on measurable features. 
By plotting feature combinations both individually and collectively, it became clear that one species consistently stood out, showing distinct separation from the others. 
This insight highlights the effectiveness of KNN classification and feature-based visualization in identifying patterns and supporting accurate species classification.
Learning: 
This project strengthened my skills in Python for data analysis and machine learning, particularly in K-Nearest Neighbors classification and feature exploration using scatter plots. 
I also learned the importance of testing multiple approaches (regression vs classification) and visualizing feature combinations both separately and together to uncover patterns and evaluate model effectiveness.
