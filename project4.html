<h2> Road Accident Risk Prediction </h2>

<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>
  The goal of this project was to analyze historical road accident data to identify high-risk areas, factors contributing to accidents, and patterns in accident occurrences. 
  By uncovering these insights, the objective was to help stakeholders, such as traffic authorities or urban planners, make data-driven decisions to improve road safety, 
  reduce accidents, and allocate resources effectively.
</p>

<h3>Data / Tools Used</h3>
<p>Power BI, SQL</p>

<h3>Analysis / Approach</h3>
<p>
  The dataset was obtained from Kaggle and pre-processed to ensure accuracy and consistency. A set of key questions was formulated to identify factors contributing to road accidents, 
  such as high-risk locations, time patterns, and accident types. Using SQL, the data was queried to answer these questions, uncover trends, and highlight significant contributing factors.
  The processed results were then imported into Power BI, where interactive visualizations and dashboards were created to clearly communicate findings. 
  Charts and maps were used to show accident distribution, high-risk zones, and patterns over time, making the analysis accessible and easy to interpret for stakeholders.

<h3>Impact / Learning</h3>
<p>
Impact

The analysis identified high-risk areas, contributing factors, and temporal patterns of road accidents, providing stakeholders with actionable insights for improving road safety. 
These insights can help traffic authorities prioritize interventions, allocate resources efficiently, and implement preventive measures to reduce accidents and enhance public safety.
Learning
This project strengthened my skills in SQL for querying large datasets and Power BI for interactive dashboards and visualization. 
I also learned how to formulate meaningful analytical questions, translate complex data into clear visual insights, and present findings in a way 
that is easily interpretable for stakeholders focused on safety and planning.
